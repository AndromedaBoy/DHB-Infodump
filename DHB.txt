Durastratoriaphobia Hellbreaker is the most powerful Non-Embassy Character in Embassy Overload. More powerful than many Embassies, Durastratoriaphobia Hellbreaker, or DHB, for short, is Hellbreaker from another universe who killed his creator, the Expunged of that universe, along with everyone else in that universe, absorbed all their collective power, and declared a one-Bambi war against our universe. After transcending rewality and warping into the void where Embassies exist, he saw them as a mere power feast. As he was just about to absorb them, the four Embassies of Height, Width, Depth, and Time, knowing what danger he would bring to the universe, collected their powers together and banished him to a realm where he could do as much damage as he wanted but not harm our universe. DHB destroyed and absorbed all he could, trying and straining to break free of this prison, until, one day, he escaped. He continued his task, and, instead of going for the Embassies directly, decided to get crafty and bide his time, capturing Embassies and using them as power batteries for his unending greed, until he could finally destroy our precious universe.
